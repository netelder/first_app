Edited with [**Multimarkdown Composer**](http://multimarkdown.com/) and reviewed with [**Marked**](http://markedapp.com/).  [**Snapz Pro X**](http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/) used for screenshots. Since switching to Mountain Lion I am also using  [**Voila**](http://www.globaldelight.com/voila/mac-screen-capture-overview.html) screen captures.

Giving up on MathJax for now (equation rendering on GitHub that is).
