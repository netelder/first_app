Edited with [**Multimarkdown Composer**](http://multimarkdown.com/) and reviewed with [**Marked**](http://markedapp.com/).  [**Snapz Pro X**](http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/) used for screenshots. Since switching to Mountain Lion I am also using  **[SimpleCap]**  for screen captures. [^1]

Giving up on MathJax for now (equation rendering on GitHub that is).

[^1]: SimpleCap allows menu capture with menu bar and blackout background.  Snapz Pro X is not ready for Mountain Lion.
