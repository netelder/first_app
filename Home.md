# Welcome to the sample_project wiki! #

This is about how to use [RubyMine] as your editor for the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial] version 3.2 by Michael Hartl. The tutorial covers three applications.  The first one is very simple, the second has some active record stuff but the three is a full blown application with lots of good stuff to learn from. I highly recommend Michael's work over any other tutorial that I have seen especially because of the depth it goes into as well as breadth.

Some of the discussion I have here is for the early apps but it is extremely easy to extend to other apps where easy is just change the app name when filling in new project dialog.
